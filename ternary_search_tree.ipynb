Also, pay attention to Corner cases: what happens if I have an empty ternary tree, does the right thing happen (i.e. do I get correct values for the length, do I get correct values for the strings that are sorted in there, etc...). Make sure to have tests in place to test for these cases. The third thing is the performance test: how does it scale with increasing number of words stored in it, how long does it take to build the ternary search tree, also how long does it take to find stuff (in worst case too). Basically, similar tests as we did for the binary tree or the sorting algorithm."
